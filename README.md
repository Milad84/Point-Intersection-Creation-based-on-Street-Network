# Point-Intersection-Creation-based-on-Street-Network
This script creates intersection points from street segments using ArcPy. It buffers the streets, performs a spatial join, and identifies intersections. The results are saved in a temporary file geodatabase. Update streets_fc with your street layer path and run in ArcGIS Pro.
